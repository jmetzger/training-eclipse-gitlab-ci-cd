# Eclipse with (E)git Training

## Projects with git

  * Linux kernel project  
  * github
  * ruby on rails
  * phpmyadmin

## Git - how does it work ? 

  * git takes snapshots 
  * git works offline
    * (git saves the complete project including all versions)
  * all files are saved in objects.  

## Git - the flow

![Git - The flow](/images/funktionsweise-git.png?650)

## Lab 1: Install (latest) 

```
# go to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads
# Choose 32bit or 64bit 
# in most cases 64bit (nowerdays) 
# -> Downloads Eclipse installer 

start eclipse installer 
# -> choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"

# Eclipse will be installed 
```

## Increase Icon-Size (works on oxygen and newer)  

  * You might want to have bigger icon size (tested on Windows) 
  * Search for "eclipse.ini" 
  * Open in editor (e.g. Notepad++)
  * Add the following 3 lines (at the end of the file):

```
-Dswt.enable.autoScale=true
-Dswt.autoScale=200
-Dswt.autoScale.method=nearest
```

## The starting point (I) : the git-repository 

  * <del>"git init" initializes a repository</del> 
  * New Repo in eclipse 
    * Go to Window -> Perspective -> Open Perspective -> Other -> Git 
      * Use Icon 3 (from the left) of the git icons \\ (Create a new git repository and add it to this view)
      * It suggests (the userdir)/git. Please add the name of your directory to your path (e.g. training) 
      * Leave the box "create bare repository" UNCHECKED.
      * Click "Finish"  
    * Go to new Project -> Java Project (if you are using java)
      * IMPORTANT: Uncheck "Use default location" (otherwice the repo will 
  * after that: All the intelligence and logic is within the subdirectory .git
  * this means: folders/files are fully functional, also if the .git - folder is deleted  


## Starting with a project : 1 and 2

  * You can also start with a project 
    * e.g. New -> Java Project ->
  * After that make i a git-repo 
    * Team -> Share 
      * Do **Not** Check: Use or create repository in parent folder  
      * Use the seperated git folder here
      * After doing that, all code will be moved to repo - folder
        * and here in the workspace 
          * Example Structure 
            * ~/git/RepoName/ <- Workspace 
            * ~/git/RepoName/.git

| tag: | "Team -> Advanced -> Tag...", annotated tags only toolbar of Commit views, ditto |

## The helper : git status

  * Within egit implicitly in status of files (decorations) 
  * Git Staging View   

## The staging area / index :

  * <del>Here you will decide, what gets shipped (for the next "git commit")</del>
  * <del>For doing so, we will use: git add</del>
  * In Eclipse you will see this information in the staging area:

```
Right Click (Mouse) -> Team -> Commit
or: 
Windows -> Show View -> Other -> Git -> Git Staging  
```

## The details : git add 

  * Done within the Git Staging Area in EGit / Eclipse 

```
Right Click (Mouse) -> Team -> Commit
or: 
Windows -> Show View -> Other -> Git -> Git Staging 
```
 
## Git and its objects  

  * To manage its data, git uses objects
  * e.g. when you add a file with git add filename \\ a new object is created 
  * There are 4 types of objects
    * blobs
    * trees
    * commits
    * tags

## SHA1 - checksums & backgrounds 

  * git extensively works with checksums in the background
  * a checksum is a 40-char long hex-string ( a unique checksum of the data ) 
  * every object gets a checksum
    * blogs
    * trees
    * commits
    * tags

## Lab 4: Find created object

```
# Works only within git bash or Linux 
# Just for reference here !! 
cd .git 
cd objects 
ls -la 
# you will find a directory name with the 
# first 2 chars of the object, e.g. 
# drwxr-xr-x   3 jmetzger  staff  102 26 Okt 16:28 4f
```

```
# change into that directory
# Hint: Replace name with your directory name 
cd 4f 
# your object 
ls -la 
# 51d02eb27b6bdf1741ad48ccf6f7dc3326bbd2
```

```
# now let us see the content 
# (taking the 4 letters of the object is sufficient) 
git cat-file -p 4f51
my first line 
```

```
# and the type of object 
git cat-file -t 4f51
blob
```

## Git - your identity (Why ?)

  * Working in a team: Who has done what ? 
  * Makes it easier to organize work.
  * You can easier search work based on Author (=Identity)

```
On newer versions your forced
to set your identity before you
you can publish your work to a remote server (=push)
``` 

## Lab 5a: Set up your identity Git (git bash/commandline)

```
# within your project (folder training)
git config --global user.name "Jochen Metzger"
git config --global user.email "j.metzger@t3company.de"
# Checking your config: 
git config --list
# Checking your config property:
git config user.email 
```

## Lab 5b: Set up your identity (Eclipse/EGit)

  * http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Identifying_yourself

```
Click Preferences > Team > Git > Configuration
Click New Entry and enter the key value pairs:
Key: user.name
Value: YourUsernameHere

And
Key: user.email
Value: YourEmailHere
```

## The journey: there we go to the (local) repository

  * the next step: get the files/directory into the repo 
  * with "git commit" the work is transferred (after git add or git add .)

## Git commit - in detail (command line)

  * git commit (commit all files from staging) 
  * git commit -a (in addition all files that have been deleted or known (and have changed))
  * git commit / git commit -a opens an editor where i can enter the commit message
  * git commit -m "my commit-message" - makes committing a oneliner 

## Git commit (Eclipse/EGit) 

```
1) Right Click on Project 
2) Team -> Commit 
```

## Git log 

  * All commits are logged in to the log 
  * You can access the log with 
    * git log 

## Git log - what in detail ? (commandline) 

  * Output the log: \\ git log 
  * --
  * a short version of logs: \\ git log --oneline 
  * --
  * all from a specific author: \\ git log --author=Max 

## Git log (Eclipse/EGit) 

```
Right Click -> Show In -> History 
or:
Right Click -> Team -> Show In -> History 
```

## Lab 6: Commit the changes and watch the log (commandline only) 

```
# look into the status
git status

git commit 
# editor opens - now add a commit message 
# & save & close the editor

# everything shoud be clean now 
git status

# you will notice the same commit-id as 
# in the commit message   
git log 
```

## Git aliases (commandline) 

  * With aliases you can create your own git commands ;o) 
  * Creation Syntax:
    * git config --global alias.name_of_alias "<git-command> <git-params>"
    * e.g. git config --global alias.cc "commit -a"
  * Usage Syntax:
    * git cc 
  * You can still add params to the command on usage:
    * git cc -m "my commit" 

## Git log - beautified (commandline) 

  * Why ? 
    * For later usage, it will be easier to have a beautified log

```
git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
```

## Lab 7: Setup beautified log (commandline) 

```
git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"

# use beautified log 
git lg 
```

## Branches -> why ? 

  * important concept of git 
  * work on features easily 
  * independent from remote repository 

## Create branches -> 1-step-version 

  * git checkout -b feature-4711 

## Branch - which one is active ? 

  * git branch (star means active) 

## change to another branch (commandline) 

  * git checkout feature-4711 

## Lab 8: Create a new branch + work there (commandline) 

```
git checkout -b feature-4711 
# check which branch is active 
git branch 

# create a file feature-4711.txt 
touch feature-4711.txt 
# create a line of text into it 
# with your favourite editor
# .e.g 
# Line of code in 4711 

# now commit the changes 
git status 
git add .
git commit -am "New feature-4711.txt" 
git status
# do you notice, that the branch is ahead ? 
git lg 
```

##  Merge changes -> merge 

  * You can merge, if you want to get changes from another branch
  * A typical scenario would be:
    * You are in master
    * Checkout a feature branch 
    * Work on a feature
    * Checkout master
    * merge changes from feature-branch 
  * You merge feature from another branch into your current branch
    * with -->
    * git merge your-feature-branch   

## Delete branch (commandline)

  * You should cleanup unused branches as frequent as possible 
  * git branch -d feature-4711 (you should not be within the branch) 

## Lab 9: Merge branch (fast-forward) - from other feature (commandline) 

```
# we did this before 
# and worked on branch 
git checkout feature-4711
git checkout master 
git merge feature-4711
# you will notice, that both branches are at the same commit-id 
git lg 
git branch -d feature-4711 
```

## Merge - FastForward - How come ? 

  * Fast-Forward just move the pointer forward
  * HEAD always points to tip of the checked out branch
  * HEAD is simply the entry in a file 
    * Content is itsef a reference 
    * Reference holds Commit-Id. 

## Lab 10: Exploring HEAD (commandline) 

``` 
cd .git 
cat HEAD 
# ref: refs/heads/master
cat refs/heads/master 
# f80891db4afa604b243bd06a5779fee88c3cad53
# compare this with the last commit - id
# What do you notice ? 
git lg -1 
```

## Replay changes in other branch + changes on current branch -> rebase (commandline) 

  * Change into branch (z.B.feature-4711) 
  * git rebase master 
  * -- how does it work ? ->
    - go back to the point where the branch was created 
    - apply change from master
    - at the end apply changes from feature-4711
  * -- ATTENTION ->
    - only do rebasing in your own "local" branch (NO ! collaborative branches)
    - never rebase, after push is done and branch is shared with others ! 

## Back in time -> reset (commandline) 

  * e.g. git reset --hard HEAD~1
  * attention: only use it, when changes are not published (remotely) yet.
  * -> It is your command,  IN CASE your are telling yourself, omg, what's that, what did i do here, let me undo that

## Cancellation -> revert (commandline) 

  * Take back the last change \\ But: you will have an additional log entry

``` 
# commandline 
git revert
```

```
# Eclipse/EGit 
1) Go to Log -> Right Click -> Show In -> History 
2) Right Click on Commit (you want to revert) -> Revert 
```

## From -> local repository -> to -> remote repository -> why ? 

### Why ? 
 
  * data is saved outside of my system 
  * others can access it too (collaboration, e.g. on a feature)

## Remote repository - examples 

  * gitlab 
  * github 
  * gitosis 
  * --
  * under the hood: git. 

## Login to gitlab / bitbucket 

  * Introduction of the gui  

## (Windows -> git bash) create private/public key pair ====

  - desktop -> right click  -> git bash
  - ssh-keygen -t rsa # set password ! 
  - cd ../.ssh 
  - cat id_rsa.pub # that's the public key 
  - Mark key with mouse -> then -> CTRL + C 
  - open gitlab in browser 
  - (gitlab) menÃ¼ -> profile settings -> SSH keys -> paste key and click button "Add Key" 
  - Test the connection with ssh git@git.server.com 

## Create a repo under gitlab/bitbucket ====

  - login
  - create repo (schulung) 
  - introduce repo locally

## Publish the local changes remote 

  * (commandline) git push origin master 
  * (Eclipse/Egit): Right click -> Team -> Push to Upstream 

## Tagging of a current version (locally)

  * eclipse/EGit -> Team -> Advanced -> Tag 

```
git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "Commit Message"
git push --tags 
```
## Getting an old revision of a file 

```
1) Rechte Maustaste 
2) Replace With (on top of entry Team) Previous Revision/Commit 
```

## Clone an online session into a new (none existant) directory ==== 

  * git bash (on the desktop - right click) 
  * git clone https://url schulung2

## where is configuration saved ? 

  * on your local system the general configuration is saved in a file.
  * Linux/Mac: ~/.gitconfig
  * --
  * example Mac: /Users/jmetzger/.gitconfig 
  * example Linux: /home/jmetzger/.gitconfig
  * example Windows: C:\Users\<user_name>\.gitconfig 

## Commit - messages: what for and why should they be speaking ? 

  * other participants should be able to see changes based on commits
  * good commit - message: reduces the time for search (for other participants) - more efficient
  * search more easily and thoroughly (e.g. for later debugging)  
  * eventually included in the changelog and other tools

## Commit - message : structure 

  * line 1: short! summary only(!) chars and letters 
  * line 1: max. 50 chars
  * line 1: best practice -> issue number/logical unit, then ":", then summary  \\ e.g. \\ modulexy: Fixed problems with memory management
  * line 2: EMPTY
  * line 3: thorough description of commit
  * line 3: max. 72 chars 
  * line 3: to structure: *, -, # possible 
  * line 3: time: presence 
  * line 3: do not write, what do you did, but why.

## The cleanup: removal and untracking : git rm (commandline) 

  * git rm \\ -- \\ removes the files locally (working directory) as well as for next staging. In the next commit the file will not be contained anymore.
  * git rm --cached \\ -- \\ (if i only want to "untrack" a file (so it should be in the repo anymore), but want to keep it locally)

## Troubleshooting ssh -> repo (tortoise/openssh) 

```
It is either possible to use openssh or plink.exe. 
Here are the most important settings for ssh.
```
 
  * git bash: echo $GIT_SSH \\ it should be: C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\ssh.exe here 
  * if not: export GIT_SSH="C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\ssh.exe" 
  * in addition in tortoisegit under settings -> network the should be the following: \\ C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\ssh.exe
